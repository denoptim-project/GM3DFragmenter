<a id="Introduction"><h3>Introduction</h3></a>
<p>
GM3DFragmenter is a tool for the fragmentation of molecules and the managment of
 libraries of the molecular fragments resulting from the fragmentation. 
The main scope of the fragmentation being the preparation of building blocks for 
automated construction of molecules according to the so-called class-based aprroach.
That is, the cutting rules used to define which bonds to break to generate fragments 
are used also to classify the main property of the attachment points replacing the 
broken bond.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>
GM3DFragmenter can perform fragmentation of both 2D and 3D molecular structures, 
thus allowing to generate the 3D fragments needed for the direct construction of 
3D structures from 3D fragments.<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup><br>
</p>


<br>
<a id="Building"><h3>Building GM3DFragmenter</h3></a>
<p>
Just run the building script named <code>build_GM3DFragmenter.sh</code>.<br>
Some other utilities are available in the <code>utils</code> folder and are NOT built 
by the above-mentioned script. To build also such utilities, run the scripts <code>utils/ExtractMostCommonConformer/build.sh</code> and <code>utils/parallelize/build_Parallelize_SplitAndMerge.sh</code>.
</p>


<br>
<a id="Running"><h3>Running GM3DFragmenter</h3></a>
<p>
To use GM3DFragmenter for any of the <a href="#Tasks">tasks listed below</a>, it is necessary to prepare a file with all the parameters defining what and how (see <a href="#Parameters">Parameters file</a>). Then, just submit the parameter file (i.e., <code>input.par</code> to GM3DFragmenter:
<br>  
<code>java -jar GM3DFragmenter.jar input.par </code>.                               
<br>
The <code>test</code> folder contains some examples of parameters file.
</p>


<br>
<a id="Parameters"><h3>Parameters file</h3></a>
<p>All the instructions to GM3DFragmenter are provided via a single parameter file.
This file is a simple text file in which you, user, have to write all the keywords
needed to make GM3DFragmenter do what you want. Each line must contain only a single
keyword or a single keyword-arguments instruction. The keyword must be written with
CAPITAL LETTERS without leading spaces. For keywords requiring one or more arguments,
spaces are used to separate both the keyword and the first argument and between arguments.
Lines starting with '#' are ignored.
Examples of Parameter files can be found in the <code>test</code> folder.
</p>


<br>
<a id="Tasks"><h3>Tasks for GM3DFragmenter</h3></a>
<p>
GM3DFragmenter is capable of a list of tasks and requires
 instructions from the user in the form of a list keywords 
(see <a href="#Parameters">Parameters file</a>) that define which tasks 
are to be performed and with which settings.
The following tasks can be performed with GM3DFragmenter both as single step, that 
is you can require the execution of one of these steps alone, and, for many of these tasks,
 in sequence. In the latter case, the tasks are executed according to the order in the 
following list using each tack the output from the preceding task. 
Note that the fragmentation of molecular object is the default task and will always be
 executed unless the keyword <a href="#NOFRAGMENTATION">NOFRAGMENTATION</a> is specified.
</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><h4>Check molecular structures.</h4>
GM3DFragment can check the consistency between the declared molecular formula of 
an input molecule and its actual structure. This is needed,
for example, when working with molecules from Cambridge Structural Database that can
have missing atoms (mainly H, but not only). See keywords 
<a href="#CHECKFORMULA">CHECKFORMULA</a> and <a href="#FORMULATXTFILE">FORMULATXTFILE</a> below.
In addition, since certain notations can lead to ambiguities, GM3DFragmenter has routines that 
try to fix the notation in the input structures. This optional task is activated with the keyword
<a href="#ANALYSEANDFIX">ANALYSEANDFIX</a>.
For example, aromatic but metal coordinating molecules are not properly treated by standard CDK 
(at least, for the time being), thus GM3DFragmenter can be used to define explicit 
alternation of single and double bonds instead of aromatic type of bonds. Again, this is 
needed if you want to use molecules taken from Cambridge Structural Database. 
Note that the de-kekulization (move bond types from aromatic to single/double)
allow to avoid ambiguities in the application of cutting rules on metal coordinating aromatics,
 but, on the other hand, may reject some molecules and thus require manual de-kekulization.
</li>
<li><h4>Filter molecular structures.</h4> 
Pre-fragmentation selection on the input molecules can be performed based on SMARTS using the keyword <a href="#PREFILTERSMARTS">PREFILTERSMARTS</a>. Molecules matching any of the given smarts will be ignored.
</li>
<li><h4>Fragment molecular structures.</h4>
Perform the fragmentation of 2D or 3D molecular objects with generation of a library 
of fragments. This is the default task for GM3DFragmenter unless
 the keyword <a href="#NOFRAGMENTATION">NOFRAGMENTATION</a> is used. 
To perform the fragmentation, GM3DFragmenter requires a formatted list of
<a href="#Cutting">cutting rules</a>. 
Other settings can be specified with the keywords below.
</li>
<li><h4>Filter molecular fragments.</h4>
A library of fragments can be filtered according to a given the selection criteria. 
This task is commonly performed during fragmentation but can also be required as 
an independent task by the use of the keyword <a href="#ONLYFILTER">ONLYFILTER</a>.
 The selection criteria applied are the same that are applied during fragmentation.
 See keywords below.
</li>
<li><h4>Split libraries of fragments (on molecular weight).</h4>
To handle more efficiently large libraries of fragments it is convenient to divide
 them into sub-libraries characterized by a range of molecular weight. The keyword 
<a href="#MWSPLITTING">MWSPLITTING</a> allows to require splitting of the library of 
fragments and specify the wideness of the MW bins.
</li>
<li><h4>Merge libraries of fragments.</h4>
Two or more libraries of fragments can be unified into a single library using the keyword 
<a href="#MERGELIBRARY">MERGELIBRARY</a>.
</li>
<li><h4>Sort library of fragments (on molecular weight).</h4>
Molecular weight-based sorting of libraries of fragments can be obtained using the keyword
<a href="#MWREORDER">MWREORDER</a>. Ascending order is the default direction, unless 
<a href="#MWREORDER">MWREORDER</a> is accompanied by
<a href="#REVERSEMWORDER">REVERSEMWORDER</a>.
</li>
<li><h4>Group rotamers of fragments.</h4>
This tasks consist in identifying the rotamers of each 3D fragment in a library and store
them into sub-libraries. Each fragments and its rotamers are assigned with an identification
label stored in the 'ISOMER' field of SDF output files. See <a href="#GROUPROTAMERS">GROUPROTAMERS</a> keyword.
</li>
<li><h4>Extract fragments based on APclass.</h4>
Fragments can be extracted from libraries looking at the attachment point class (APclass) using the keyword <a href="#EXTRACTCLASS">EXTRACTCLASS</a>
</li>
<li><h4>Extract fragments based on SMARTS.</h4>
Fragments can be extracted from libraries using SMARTS queries using the keyword <a href="#EXTRACTSMARTS">EXTRACTSMARTS</a>
</li>
<li><h4>Create Compatibility Matrix from cutting rules.</h4>
Using the keyword <a href="#MAKECPMFROMRULES">MAKECPMFROMRULES</a> you can write the simplest compatibility matrix related with the list of cutting rules provided. 
</li>
</ol>
Not all of these tasks can be executed in sequence. Apart from the logical sequence of task 
(A,B,C,D,G) which is of naturally permitted, the user can chose to perform only some of 
these steps combining them also with G and/or H. The user will have to provide all the 
required keywords in one parameter file
(see the <code>test</code> folder). The same applies to input files, with the exception of
structure-type of input that is passes internally from a task to the next one in the sequence. 
On the contrary, tasks like E,F,I,J, and K generate multiple output and, apart from combinations
 with G and H, are not tested in sequence-type of jobs and may require some development.


<br>
<a id="Cutting"><h3>Cutting rules</h3></a>
<p>The cutting rules define which bonds should be broken to generate molecular fragments. 
A single formatted text file is used to provide the cutting rules to GM3DFragmenter. 
The following keywords are recognized:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>ANY</b>: used to specify rule components matching any atom;</li>
<li><b>CTR</b>: used to identify a single cutting rule.</li>
</ul>
Lines starting with the <b>CTR</b> keyword must adhere to the following format:<br>
<code>CTR [rulename] [inv_priority] [1st_atm_SMARTS] [2nd_atm_SMARTS] [bnd_SMARTS] [options]</code>
Where
<ul>
<li><code>[rulename]</code> is a single word defining the mane of the cutting rule. The class
 of attachment points generated by the action of the cutting rule derives from this rule name.</li>
<li><code>[inv_priority]</code> is an integer (with sign) that is used to specify the priority 
order for the application of cutting rules. GM3DFragmenter will apply the rules starting
 from the lowest <code>[inv_priority]</code> in ascending order.</li>
<li><code>[1st_atm_SMARTS]</code> is an atom SMARTS query matching one of the atoms involved in the bond.</li>
<li><code>[2nd_atm_SMARTS]</code> is an atom SMARTS query matching one of the atoms involved in the bond.</li>
<li><code>[bnd_SMARTS]</code> is a bond SMARTS query matching the bond between the atoms identified above.</li>
<li><code>[options]</code> is an optional list of properties that apply to the cutting rule. 
For a candidate bond to be considered a true match, all optional conditions must be satisfied simultaneously (i.e., logical AND).
  <ul>
  <li><code>HAPTO</code> specifies that the bond matched by the cutting rule has to be part of 
  multihapto system.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> Not compatible with RING and OMRING options.</li>
  <li><code>RING>n</code> (where n is an integer) specifies that the target bond, if part of an organic ring (i.e., not containing any metal atoms), is considered a true match only if the number of ring members is above <code>n</code>.</li>
  <li><code>OMRING>n</code> (where n is an integer) works like RING>n but is restricted to rings involving one or more metals.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
The <code>data</code> folder contains examples of cutting rules used in various contexts. 





<br>
<a id="Parallelization"><h3>Parallelization</h3></a>
Despite the fact that GM3DFragmenter performs simple operations
usually on small molecules (150-200 atoms), the task becomes very demanding with the 
increase of the number of molecules, cutting rules and fragments to handle. On the other
hand, the nature of the tasks is that of an embarrassingly parallel problem. In fact,
the fragmentation of each molecule is totally independent from the fate other molecules.
While a robust parallelized version of GM3DFragmenter is still to be written, you can exploit
the availability of several processors by applying a bunch of tools and scripts (located in 
<code>utils/parallelize</code> folder) that will perform these steps:
<ol type="I">
<li>Split the fragmentation into smaller fragmentation tasks (fewer molecules).</li>
<li>Run small fragmentations in parallel.</li>
<li>Split each library of fragments according to molecular weight (MW).</li>
<li>Merge all the fragment libraries referring to the same MW and get unique fragments.</li>
<li>Merge the libraries of unique fragments.</li>
</ol>
The procedure is semi-automatic, meaning that the user has to manually start the scripts 
entitled to perform each of the steps. This is because the single tasks in each of the steps 
(splitting, fragmentation, splitting, merging and final merging) can
be completed at different moments. Therefore, the user must verify that all tasks 
are completed before embarking into the next step. <br>
<b>WARNING!</b> For the moment the scripts and tools are meant to work on a cluster with PBS 
queue system (i.e., fimm.bccs.uib.no with the <code>-queueFIMM</code> option). In alternative, for test, you can play with a Linux 
workstation (using <code>-queue187</code> option; see help message from <code>java -jar ParallelizeGM3DF.jar</code>)
<br>
To be more pragmatic, here is the detailed procedure that allows to parallelize the 
fragmentation of a large library of molecules with GM3dFragmenter (note that
 the tools have to be built
 before deployment; see also <a href="#Building">Building GM3DFragmenter</a>). 
Note that log files (named <code>log*</code>) are generated for the most time consuming steps.
Before moving to the next step you should check that all tasks of a given step have been completed,
for example, you can search for the "<code>Task completed</code>" message in the log files 
of a given step before continuing to the next step.

<ol type="I">
<li>Run ParallelizeGM3DF.jar to prepare the scripts and input for small fragmentation tasks.
<br>Have a look at the help message with <code>java -jar ParallelizeGM3DF.jar</code>. 
   <br>
   <br><code>java -jar ParallelizeGM3DF.jar [options]</code>
   <br>
   <br>
</li>
<li>Run small fragmentation. Submit the fragmentation jobs to the queue.
   <br>
   <br><code>./RunAllGM3DFragmentation_*</code><br>
   <br>
</li>
<li>When all fragmentations are completed, run SplitAndMerge.jar to split the libraries of fragments according to MW.
<br>Have a look at the help message with <code>java -jar SplitAndMerge.jar</code>
   <br>
   <br><code>java -jar SplitAndMerge.jar split [options]</code><br>
   <br><code>./RunAllSPLITTING_*</code><br>
   <br>
</li>
<li>When all splitting tasks are completed, run SplitAndMerge.jar to merge all the fragments belonging to the same MW range.
   <br>
   <br><code>java -jar SplitAndMerge.jar merge [options]</code><br>
   <br><code>./RunAllMERGING_*_*</code><br>
   <br>
</li>
<li>(Optional) You may want to update the isomer's identification numbers (i.e., SDF field <code>ISOMER</code>). These numerical labels (format X_XXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXX) can be used to identify alternative conformations of a fragment. 
When fragments are clustered in a parallel fashion, the ISOMER codes remain consistent <b>ONLY WITHIN A SINGLE THREAD</b>. 
Nevertheless, with the execution of <code>SplitAndMerge</code> a BASH script named <code>RunAllFrgKeyConversion.sh</code> is produced and can be used to change the ISOMER codes in a consistent manner.<br> 
Note that this step is required only when <code>ExtractMostCommonConformer</code> is to be used to extract the representative conformation from a library that has been generated using the <a href="#KEEPDUPLICATES">KEEPDUPLICATES</a> option.
   <br>
   <br><code>RunAllFrgKeyConversion.sh</code><br>
   <br>
</li>
<li>Collect the results into one library of unique fragments and one library with all the fragments.
   <br>
   <br><code>makeSingleLib.sh</code><br>
   <br>
</li>
<li>(Optional) To extract the most representative conformation of a fragment, provided that you have kept the duplicates during the fragmentation step (<a href="#KEEPDUPLICATES">KEEPDUPLICATES</a> keyword), you can use <code>ExtractMostCommonConformer</code>: 
   <br>
   <br><code>java -jar ExtractMostCommonConformer [options] lib_allFrags.sdf</code><br>
   <br>
This will find the most representing fragmnet by comparing all fragments that are labelled with the same ISOMER code, and aligning the 3D geometries independently on the atom lists. The size of this problem scales quickly with the number of atoms in the fragments, and the number of fragments to compare. In practice, to extract the most representative fragment for fragments with more than 10 atoms/attachment_points, the number of candidate framgents should be lower than 50.
</li>
